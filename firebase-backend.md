```
4. In the same folder run these commands:
```
firebase functions:config:set gmail.clientid="your client id"
firebase functions:config:set gmail.clientsecret="your client secret"
firebase functions:config:set gmail.refreshtoken="your refresh token"
firebase functions:config:set gmail.accesstoken="your access token"
```
